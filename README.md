# TimeSeriesForecasting

This modules implements a LSTM forecasting class for univariate time series. 
A first test is made on sums of sinusoides and cosinusoides and a second one on financial stock returns data. 

LSTM are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network designed specifically for sequence forecasting. Here we build a forecasting engine leveraging the LSTM or Long Term Short Term Memory functionalities from Pytorch.
